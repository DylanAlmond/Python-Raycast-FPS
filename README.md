# Python Raycast FPS

This project was developed as a college assignment over approximately two weeks. Drawing inspiration from classic shooters like **Half-Life 1** and **Doom**, the game is a **2.5D first-person shooter** built with Python and the [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) library. The goal was to replicate the atmosphere and gameplay of retro shooters within a simplified engine.
